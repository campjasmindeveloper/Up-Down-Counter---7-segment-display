# Up-Down-Counter---7-segment-display
Verilog module for a 7-segment display on the Nexys-4 board.

The 4 bits should display the digits 0-9 and A-F. The displays should scroll the displayed digit across the eight 7 segment displays on the NEXYS-4 board using only 1 digit at a time, slowly moving across using the counted down slow clock.
